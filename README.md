your machine. Please ensure that you have Perl installed on your computer.

	- Via SSH: `git clone git@github.com:btmonier/perlseq.git`
	- Vis https: `https://github.com/btmonier/perlseq.git`

2) If you have downloaded a zip file of this repo, unzip it and navigate to the `perlseq` directory

2) Place text files or `.fasta` files into the folder where the Perl script is located;

3) If your file that you want to used for analysis is not located in the folder with the Perl script, please enter the exact location of where it is located (e.g. `~/path/to/file`).
